in this module we will actually see how one can split file 
and break up aour back code into parts such as  : 

1. routes 
2. request handlers 
3. server process 
4. main file 

etc..

we will also see how connections are established 
between two or multiple files 

NOTE : KEEP IN MIND TO MOVE THE CODE OF
"ind.js" FILE TO "index.js" of main 
THEN ONLY IT WILL RUN 

KEEP OTHER FILES AS IT IS AS THE ROUTES ARE CONNECTED IN 
THAT MANNER
